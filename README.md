# Hi there üëã

## üê±‚Äçüëì About Me
### Who are you ?
I am CAMAIN √âlie, a **Full Stack Web Developer** with a slight preference for **Front End** development and mostly specialized in **React** and **Node.js** technologies.
I'm a French guy, living in France (yeah I know, how original haha ?!). I'm very **curious**, so apart from development, I love learning all kinds of things (currently learning to speak Brazilian portuguese, climbing and calisthenics).
I'm quite **open minded** and here are a few more things that I like : beers, books, movies, pizzas, cooking.
Oh, almost forgot, as almost everybody, I love travelling as well !

### What are you currently working on ?
I am currently developing a [Space shooter mini game](https://github.com/camain-elie/space-shooter), learning Node.js in depth and slowly getting familiar with Three.js. 
<!--My next goal will be to complete [devChallenge.io's Full-stack Developer path](https://devchallenges.io/paths/full-stack-developer). -->
Also, I am actually looking for a job in France or abroad. If you've got a job to offer me, please feel free to [contact me](#links) !

### Anything else ?
As mentioned above, I am currently seeking job as a fullstack or front end developer in France or abroad (in full remote).If you have an opportunity that you think fits my profile, please [get in touch with me](#links) !
Apart from that, that's it ! Feel free to ask if you want to know anything else about me ! üòÄ
